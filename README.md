scene one: its a hot summer night in july, you hear crickets chirping, the wind calls out to you, what does it say?

button: your sins are not a reflection of you. your eyes burn with the love of those who you have touched. live a little while longer?

→ scene two: the words ring in your ears, how do you reply?

button one: the sun sets off the horizon, i think i will stick around for another day

→ scene three, ending one: your mother calls you in for dinner, the rocking chair creaks as you get up. you feel the breeze tickle your neck as you stand in the doorway, closing the door. you make it to eighty, the light at the end of the tunnel displays her silhouette

button two: the sins i pursue haunt me. in the mirror, she laughs at me. i listen.

→ scene four: the wind sings, "the mirror is nothing but glass. she can crack. she can break. your reflection is a hazy ghost. will you let her haunt you?

button one: i hold the controls. i chose not to let my sins define me. i will stick around another day.

→ scene five, ending two: the windchimes above your porch whisper in agreement. when you walk into your house you break every mirror. identity is both a cage and a construct. you will not let the dead haunt you any further. your mother finds you sobbing in the foyer. she feeds you pomegrantes. the beads taste like god.

button two: i cannot leave her. i welcome ghosts into my home, into my heart. she is the only one who keeps me company

→ scene six, ending three: ghosts are greedy. they envy the living. they want you to keep them by your side, if only its in your tomb. when the mirror taunts, you listen, when she calls, you come. you stand on feet shes given you, but they're rotten. they rust. they move on their own. you walk into the woods, you don't ever come out.
